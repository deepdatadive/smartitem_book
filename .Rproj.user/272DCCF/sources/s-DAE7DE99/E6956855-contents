Any text you want to put to explain what happens before or after.

```{r cars, }
summary(cars)
print('hi')
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
