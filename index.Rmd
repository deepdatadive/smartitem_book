# Preface

This book is a **compilation** of different reseach pieces all compiled together into a single volume. The purpose of the volume is to provide a concise, research oriented view of the smart item and other accompanying item formats. Each chapter will be a different research topic and we will attempt to group similar research articles in close proximity to each other within the book.
